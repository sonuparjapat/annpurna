    Here at The Hermitage we have done our best to conform to the principles of Vastu Vidya, the ancient Indian ‘knowledge of building’ that that determines the orientation and construction of the built environment. Traditional Vastu texts prescribe principles of design, layout, measurements, ground preparation and arrangement of space, with a view to integrating the building with its natural surroundings and optimising the various functions performed within it.

        On our site, the prime example of this wholistic approach to human habitation is the Annapurna dining room. Named after the goddess of nourishment, ‘She who is full (purna) of food (anna)’, the structure is visually stunning. A huge interior space that, rising like an arboreal cathedral, lifts the spirits as soon as you step inside and, once you have, exerts a powerful feeling of peace uncluttered spatial harmony and peace.  This generous space is very flexible: as well as serving as a restaurant, Annapurna can host meetings and conferences, concerts of dance and music and yoga sessions. It also houses the well-stocked hotel library and is the venue for our popular cookery lessons. The inner space revolves around the open well at its centre, which is open to the sky above. In vastu theory, this is called the brahmasthan, which allows the creative energy of the unbounded to descend into the built space and permeate it with positive life-force.

            In ecological terms, Annapurna is a prime example of sustainable architecture, a futuristic indication of a more responsible and appropriate way of building. From initial plans to final snagging details, only local people and skills were involved. The construction is almost entirely natural, utilising locally quarried granite stone and locally grown hardwood and ghee grass thatch. These materials have been combined along the lines of a traditional Kerala tribal longhouse, and carved and dressed by craftsmen whose usual work is the intricate embellishment of temples. All the ceiling fans are made of recycled wood, as is much of the rest of the structure. All the furniture is wooden and locally produced to our own designs, even the rugs are handwoven. </h4>

            The dining room consumes virtually no energy. Its elegant pillared lateral spaces are open to the verdant gardens on all sides, allowing a sea-cooled breeze to circulate, while the warmer air is released upwards through the large, open light well that stands in the centre of the hall. With such natural ventilation secured, there is no need of air-conditioning, which is very costly in energy terms, and during the day, no need of any electricity. What light is needed after dark is subdued and comes from small and localised sources, while the dining tables and sitting areas are lit by candles.

    <h4 class="maincontent">
        The food served in Annapurna is sourced locally from farm and fishing boat to table, and uses only natural ingredients from the nearby hills, spice gardens and ocean. You won’t find a plastic bottle here, nor indeed anywhere on site, as we have operated a strict ‘no plastic’ policy ever since we first opened more than ten years ago. This was prescient, as we are all belatedly waking up to the curse of unrecyclable plastic, and we hope other hotels will soon follow our lead.
